# WeatherappTkinter
This is a project to get current weather data using openweather api and displayed with Tkinter
This is written in a python file and has a ini file to be able to read from, this also has a weather_icons file which holds each icon of the current weather.

Three files that you will have are:
config.ini
weather_app.py
weather_icons

Create an api key from openweather https://openweathermap.org/api

Download/Save each of the weather icons https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions

create a config.ini file to be able to store your api key

This shows example of the json format from getting a current weather response https://openweathermap.org/current#list

The weather_app.py file is commented explaining steps on each line of code

the config.ini file holds the api key that is being read from the weather_app.py file

This is an example of what the product looks like when conducting a search for London current weather.
